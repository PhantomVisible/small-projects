# 🧩 Small Projects — Learning by Building

Welcome to my collection of small projects and experiments, where I learn, explore, and build hands-on applications to strengthen my skills in software development.

Each project is a focused exercise in mastering a concept, framework, or language — from backend development with Java & Spring Boot, to scripting, APIs, and beyond.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning lab, where I:

- Practice real-world programming concepts.

- Explore different tools, frameworks, and technologies.

- Build a library of clean, reusable mini-projects.

- Document my growth as a developer through consistent practice.

## 💡 “The best way to learn is to build — one project at a time.”

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each folder represents a self-contained project with its own source code, dependencies, and short documentation.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

Throughout these projects, I work with:

- Java (OOP, Streams, Collections, File I/O)

- Spring Boot & Spring Framework

- SQL (MySQL, JDBC basics)

- Git & GitHub for version control
